# Configuration

This project uses the v2 JSON configuration below. The v1 schema (top-level
`server` and `clients` keys) has been removed: rename them to `mcpProxy` and
`mcpServers`, and lift each client's `config` object into the server entry
itself, so that

```jsonc
{"clients": {"fetch": {"type": "stdio", "config": {"command": "uvx", "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]}}}}
```

becomes

```jsonc
{"mcpServers": {"fetch": {"command": "uvx", "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]}}}
```

`panicIfInvalid`, `logEnabled` and `authTokens` move into the entry's `options`,
and the proxy's `globalAuthTokens` become `mcpProxy.options.authTokens`.

## mcpProxy

- `baseURL`: Public URL base used to build client endpoints.
- `addr`: Bind address (e.g. `:9090`).
- `name`, `version`: Server identity for MCP handshake.
- `type`: `sse` (default) or `streamable-http`.
- `options`: Defaults inherited by `mcpServers.*.options` (can be overridden per server).
- `startupGracePeriod` (duration string, default `"30s"`): how long `/_readyz` reports
  `initializing` while clients are still connecting. After it, the proxy reports ready
  and any straggler mounts when it finishes, so one slow server cannot keep the whole
  proxy out of rotation.

## mcpServers

Each entry's key is the server name, which becomes its route
(`<baseURL path>/<serverName>/`). It must be a clean relative URL path: it
cannot be empty, contain `.`, `..` or empty segments, start or end with `/`,
or contain `\`, `{`, `}` or control characters. Multiple segments are allowed
(see the token-in-the-route trick in `USAGE.md`).

Each entry defines a downstream MCP server. Supported client types:

- `stdio` (implicit when `command` is set): run a subprocess via stdio.
- `sse` (implicit when `url` is set and `transportType` ≠ `streamable-http`): connect via Server‑Sent Events.
- `streamable-http` (requires `transportType: "streamable-http"`): connect via HTTP streaming.

Common fields:

- `command`, `args`, `env` — for `stdio` clients.
- `url`, `headers` — for `sse` and `streamable-http` clients.
- `timeout` — request timeout for `sse` and `streamable-http`. Write it as a
  duration string: `"timeout": "30s"`. A bare number means **nanoseconds**
  (`"timeout": 30` is 30ns, not 30 seconds), so anything under a millisecond is
  rejected at startup rather than silently failing every request.
- `oauth` — for `sse` and `streamable-http` clients that require interactive OAuth instead of (or in addition to) `headers` (see below).
- `options` — per‑server overrides and filters (see below).

## oauth

Some remote MCP servers (e.g. Notion's hosted MCP) require the full OAuth
2.1 authorization-code flow and reject static bearer tokens outright. Set
an `oauth` block on an `sse`/`streamable-http` server to have mcp-proxy act
as the OAuth client on the downstream connection:

- `clientId`, `clientSecret` (optional): static client credentials. Omit
  both to use RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, which is performed
  automatically the first time you authorize.
- `redirectUri` (optional): local callback URL used during the one-time
  interactive authorization. Defaults to `http://localhost:8090/oauth/callback`.
  It must use `http`, a loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`), an
  explicit port, and a non-root callback path. The callback listener never
  binds to a public interface.
- `scopes` (optional): OAuth scopes to request.
- `pkceDisabled` (bool, optional): disable PKCE. PKCE is enabled by default.
- `authServerMetadataUrl` (optional): override discovery of the authorization
  server's metadata document. Needed for providers whose protected-resource
  metadata (RFC 9728) advertises an `authorization_servers` entry with a
  non-empty path (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com/v1/mcp`): this library's
  discovery always appends `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` after
  the full issuer URL (OpenID Connect Discovery convention), but RFC 8414
  requires inserting it *before* the path when one is present, and some
  providers (Datadog, at time of writing) only serve the document at the
  RFC 8414 location. If servers connected via `oauth` fail discovery,
  check `<issuer>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` vs.
  `<scheme>://<host>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server<path>` by hand
  and set this field to whichever one responds.

Tokens are persisted to `<user config dir>/mcp-proxy/oauth/<server>.json`
(e.g. `~/.config/mcp-proxy/oauth/notion.json` on Linux) and refreshed
automatically using the stored refresh token as they expire. Before the
daemon can use an `oauth`-configured server, you must authorize it once —
see the `-authorize` flag in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

When `clientId` is left empty, the dynamically-registered client (RFC
7591) is also persisted, to `<user config dir>/mcp-proxy/oauth/<server>.client.json`.
This matters: registration only happens inside the one-off `-authorize`
process, so without persisting it, a freshly started daemon would build a
new OAuth handler with an empty client ID and every token refresh would
silently be rejected by the provider once the access token expires -
looking, from the logs, like a refresh failure with no obvious cause.

## options

- `panicIfInvalid` (bool): If true, startup fails when a client cannot initialize.
- `pingInterval` (duration string, default `"30s"`): how often the connection is probed
  to keep it alive and to notice it died. This is how quickly `/_readyz` turns
  `degraded` after a downstream goes away.
- `logEnabled` (bool): Log requests and events for this client.
- `authTokens` ([]string): Valid bearer tokens; requests must include `Authorization: <token>`.
- `toolFilter` (object): Selectively expose tools to the proxy:
  - `mode`: `allow` or `block`.
  - `list`: List of tool names.
- `Disabled` (bool): Enable or disable this server. Disabled servers are skipped at startup.

Notes:

- `mcpProxy.options.authTokens` serves as the default token set if a server omits `options.authTokens`.
- An empty `authTokens` array is rejected at startup, at either level. Omitting the key (or
  writing `null`) means "inherit the proxy's tokens", but `[]` is a third state that inherits
  nothing and attaches no authentication, leaving the route open while the config reads as
  configured. Remove the key to inherit, or list at least one token.
- To discover tool names for filtering, start without a filter and check logs for lines like `<server> Adding tool <name>`.
